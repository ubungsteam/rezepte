Ingredients
-----------

- 3 eggs
- 1 c. honey
- 3 kumquats, whole (can substitute orange zest and a bit of juice if desired)
- 2 tsp. orange flower or rose water (optional)
- 3 oz. chopped almonds or macadamia nuts (fruits of the Mallorn tree)
- 1/4 c. melted butter
- 2 1/4 c. flour (barley flour of you want to be really accurate)
- 1/2 tsp. salt

Directions
----------

Put the eggs, butter, honey, kumquats, rose or orange flower water, and nuts in
a food processor or blender. Blend on high for 2-4 minutes. Add 1 cup of the
flour. Blend for a minute or two. Put mixture into a bowl and add the remaining
flour and the salt. Whisk or stir until well blended. Bake a small amount of
dough (about two tablespoons) at a time on a pizzelle or iron about 15 seconds
or until lightly brown, for a flat bread like texture. They can also be baked
at 350 degrees for about 10-15 minutes. Wrap in a leaf and tie with a string.
